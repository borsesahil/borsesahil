            <h2>Company Overview</h2>
            <p>KIA is one of the fastest growing manufacturer of electric vehicles...</p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Kia EV6 does best is take the time spent between driving a fully-electric vehicle between charges and makes it worthwhile. Without tangling its owners into the scientific experiment of owning an EV, the EV6 provides a pleasant ride, good performance, and a spacious cabin. Its distractingly cool-dude styling is meaningful and makes this Kia SUV look like something special rather than like everything else. For range, the EV6 offers as much as 310 EPA-estimated miles. For fun, the EV6 GT performance version blasts off with 576 horsepower. With a peak DC-fast charging rate of about 225 kW, the EV6 re-juices quickly, making it an easier way to travel long distances on electricity. It has many advantages over its competitors, such as the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Volkswagen ID.4, and Nissan Ariya, but the EV6 is slightly more expensive than its twin, the Hyundai Ioniq 5.</p>
