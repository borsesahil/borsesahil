            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2018, Hyundai has made no secret of its plans to be Australia’s leader in electric vehicles, promising a slew of new models by 2025. Case in point is the 2022 Hyundai Kona Electric Standard Range, which joins the brand’s expanded Kona EV line-up, offering less driving range than the original Kona EV (now renamed Extended Range) but at a more affordable price. Price has long been a barrier to larger-scale electric vehicle uptake, and with the Kona EV Standard Range, Hyundai is making moves to democratise EV ownership.</p>
