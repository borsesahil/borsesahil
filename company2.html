            <h2>Company Overview</h2>
            <p>Hyndai is one of the fastest growing manufacturer of electric vehicles...</p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>In 2008, Hyundai began mass-producing hybrids for the consumer market using what it calls “BlueDrive” technology, which includes using lithium-polymer batteries (the current industry norm are lithium-ion batteries, with both types coming with their own set of pros and cons). 
                Demonstrating how serious it is about developing cars using alternate power sources, Hyundai spent a whopping $45.6 billion developing the full electric Hyundai BlueOn in 2009, which came with a 16.4 kWh lithium polymer battery pack and the ability to charge to 80 per cent after just 25 minutes. 
                In 2016 Hyundai took on Toyota’s top-selling hybrid, the Prius, with its Ioniq - the first ever car to come in hybrid, plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and all-electric variants, yet no ICE option whatsoever.</p>
